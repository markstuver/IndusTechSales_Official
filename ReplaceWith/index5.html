				<p><strong>Welcome</strong> to the demo for FLATCMS. You can <a href="/filecms/admin/index.php">login here</a> to install and use FLATCMS.</p>
				<!-- InstanceEndEditable -->
				<p>For the admin login you can use <strong>(name) admin - (pass) 1</strong> or as user <strong>(name) user - (pass)&nbsp; 1</strong></p>
				<p>FLATCMS is one of the most simple Content Management System (CMS) there is. With FLATCMS the owner of a website can easily edit the content. This doesn't require any knowlegde about websites or HTML.</p>
				<p>You can install FLATCMS in any existing website or just use a html template. You provide the HTML-files with some editable region tags. FLATCMS will then know which parts it's allowed to edit. It doesn't matter if you made the HTML-files yourself or if they're made by software like Dreamweaver, Frontpage, Studio Webdesign, WebCreator etc.</p>
				<p>As an Administrator you have your own login code. This allows you to easily change the configuration, like hide certain folders, switch on/off buttons in the Editor or changing the language and set the login code for a user.</p>
				<h2>Explanation</h2>
				<p>It's really easy to install FLATCMS.</p>
				<ol>
				<li>Just put some tags (&lt;!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="one" --&gt; and &lt;!-- InstanceEndEditable --&gt;) around the areas in your website that may be updated.</li>
				<li>Upload the files to your server.</li>
				<li>Install FLATCMS on your website and login. (upload the dir admin)</li>
				</ol>
				<p>FLATCMS will directly scan you website for files with these tags and allow a user to edit these regions.</p>

				<h3><!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="nm_tx_faq" -->F.A.Q.<!-- InstanceEndEditable --></h3>
				<p><strong>1. During the installation I get the error "The test-file on the FTP cannot be found with....".</strong><br />This almost always means that the field "FTP" &raquo; "Root directory" is not filled in correctly. Open your FTP program and browse to the root of the website, where you see the subdirectory "cms" and your html-files. Put this current path (for example /httpdocs/) in the installation field "FTP" &raquo; "Root directory". Click again on "Install".<br /><br /><strong>2. FLATCMS is installed correctly, but it doesnt show any files to edit.</strong><br />There can be 2 problems which cause this to happen.</p>
				<ul>
				<li>1. You didnt add the (correct!!) editable region-tags. Please read the installation manual for more information how-to integrate the editable region-tags.</li>
				<li>2. The root directory where the CMS is installed on, doesnt allow the CMS to read a list of the files. Please CHMOD the root directory to "755", "766" or "777" and try again.</li>
				</ul>
				<p><strong>3. FLATCMS worked before, but now I get errors or it doesnt function anymore. Whats wrong?</strong><br />The environment probably changed. Maybe the webhosting, ftp logins or paths on the webserver changed. Open the config.php and remove the username and password values. Save the file and upload it to the FTP. This will force the installation to start. Follow the installation procedure and afterwords the CMS has to function normal again.</p>
                <p><strong>4. My css doesn't work in the WYSIWYG</strong><br />Then you probally have an advanced website and FLATCMS cannot read the css properly. You can overule the automatic css by editing the editor.css file which can be found in the admin dir</p>
                <p><strong>5. Some things seems not to work</strong><br />Open the admin/config.php and set DEBUG_MODE to 1. In case of any errors they will show up on screen.</p>
                <p><strong>6. Copy pages doesn't work</strong><br />Some host has blocked php from creating files. Use the ftp settings in the configuration to overcome this issue.</p>
